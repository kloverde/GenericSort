# GenericSort
Various sorting algorithms implemented in Java with generics

Note:  This is a for-fun project.  If you're looking to become familiar
with sorting algorithms or Java generics, you might find this project
interesting.  If you're looking to perform sorting in an actual project,
you're advised to use Java's built-in Collections.sort(), which uses the
highly-efficient TimSort.  See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#sort%28java.util.List%29.
